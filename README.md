## Documentation

[See the full documentation on our GitHub pages site](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/OVERVIEW.html) - the generic use and installation instructions there will work for this package.

Information about the base reader this package relies on can be found in the `bioio-base` repository [here](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-base)

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install bioio-sldy`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-sldy.git`

### Conda (recommended for development)

Create an environment from the provided `environment.yml` and install the package in editable mode:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bioio-sldy
pip install -e .
```

If you prefer a one-step environment creation that installs the package editable via pip, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bioio-sldy
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
python -c "import bioio_sldy; print(bioio_sldy.__name__)"
```

### Conda (recommended for reproducible environments)

Create the conda environment defined in `environment.yml` and install the package in editable mode for development:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bioio-sldy
```

If you prefer to install the package directly from the repo (editable):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
python -c "import bioio_sldy; import bioio; print('bioio-sldy', bioio_sldy.__name__)"
```

## Example Usage (see full documentation for more examples)

Install bioio-sldy alongside bioio:

`pip install bioio bioio-sldy`


This example shows a simple use case for just accessing the pixel data of the image
by explicitly passing this `Reader` into the `BioImage`. Passing the `Reader` into
the `BioImage` instance is optional as `bioio` will automatically detect installed
plug-ins and auto-select the most recently installed plug-in that supports the file
passed in.
```python
from bioio import BioImage
import bioio_sldy

img = BioImage("my_file.sld", reader=bioio_sldy.Reader)
img.data
```
